## Overview

**StudySync** is a platform designed to manage academic data and enable real-time communication between students and lecturers. The project is split into two parts:

- **Perl Backend:** Provides RESTful APIs, integrates with a MariaDB database, and handles real-time notifications.
- **Vue.js Frontend:** Offers a responsive user interface to interact with the backend services.

---

## Goals

1. **Reliability:** Robust server-side logic for handling API requests and data transfer.
2. **Integration:** Seamless interaction with the MariaDB database.
3. **Scalability:** Supports a growing user base and evolving feature set.
4. **User-Friendly:** Clean and intuitive front-end built with Vue.js.

---

## Features

- **RESTful APIs:** Endpoints for user authentication, data management, and notifications.
- **Database Integration:** Efficient CRUD operations with MariaDB.
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSocket support for live updates.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Best practices in user management and access control.
- **Modern Frontend:** Vue.js-based interface for a smooth user experience.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Linux, macOS, or Windows (with WSL recommended for Linux commands)
- **Docker:** Installed and running (for MariaDB and optionally for backend)
- **Perl (v5.10 or later):** Including [Mojolicious](https://mojolicious.org/)
- **Node.js & npm:** For the Vue.js front end
- **Vue CLI (optional):** If you plan to run and build the Vue app locally

---

## Installation and Setup

### Backend (Perl) Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/studysync.git
   cd studysync/backend
   ```

2. **Set Up MariaDB Using Docker:**
   Run the following command to start a MariaDB container:
   ```bash
   docker run --name studysync-mariadb \
     -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
     -e MYSQL_DATABASE=studysync \
     -p 3306:3306 \
     -d mariadb:latest
   ```
   Alternatively, if you have a `docker-compose.yml` file, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Install Perl Dependencies:**
   Use CPAN (or cpanminus) to install the required Perl modules:
   ```bash
   cpan Mojolicious DBI DBD::mysql
   ```
   *Tip:* If you encounter permission issues, consider running as a user with proper privileges or use `sudo` if needed.

4. **Configure the Database Connection:**
   Edit `config/database.conf` with your database settings:
   ```ini
   [database]
   host = 127.0.0.1
   port = 3306
   user = root
   password = yourpassword
   database = studysync
   ```

### Frontend (Vue.js) Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Node Modules:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Check the Available Scripts:**
   To see what scripts are available, run:
   ```bash
   npm run
   ```
   Typically, the Vue.js project will have a script such as `"serve"` or `"start"` for development. If you need a `dev` script and itâ€™s missing, update your `package.json` under the `"scripts"` section. For example:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "serve": "vue-cli-service serve",
     "build": "vue-cli-service build"
   }
   ```

## Running the Project

### Starting the Backend

- **Directly (without Docker Compose):**
  From the `backend` directory:
  ```bash
  perl working.pl daemon -l http://*:80
  ```
  The backend server will run and be accessible at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80).

- **Using Docker Compose:**
  If you have configured `docker-compose.yml` for both backend and database:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

### Starting the Frontend

- **Development Mode:**
  In the `frontend` directory, start the development server (using the correct npm script):
  ```bash
  npm run serve
  ```
  The Vue.js app will typically run on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or another port as specified).

- **Production Build:**
  To build the frontend for production:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  Then, you can serve the static files with a web server of your choice.

## Folder Structure

### Root Directory
- **.dockerignore:** Files and directories ignored during Docker builds.
- **.gitattributes:** Repository file handling settings.
- **.github/**: GitHub workflows and configuration for CI/CD.
- **Dockerfile:** Defines how to build the backend Docker image.
- **docker-compose.yml:** Orchestrates multi-container setups (backend and MariaDB).
- **README.md:** This file.

### Backend Specific
- **/lib:** Mojolicious controllers and helper modules.
- **/public:** Static assets (images, JS, CSS).
- **/templates:** Embedded Perl templates for rendering views.
- **/config:** Configuration files (including database settings).
- **working.pl / server.pl:** Main server script(s) to launch the backend.

### Frontend Specific

- **/public:** Public static files for the Vue.js app.
- **package.json:** Contains the scripts and dependencies for the Vue.js project.

### SQL Files
- **createtable.sql:** SQL script to create necessary tables.
- **droptable.sql:** SQL script to drop tables (useful for resets).
- **dummydata.sql:** Dummy data for testing.

### Other Files

---

## Testing

### API Testing (Backend)
1. **Using postTest.js:**
   ```bash
   node postTest.js
   ```
2. **Using curl:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:80/api/exampleEndpoint \
        -d '{"key":"value"}' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```
3. **Using Postman:**
   Import the API endpoints and test interactively.

### Frontend Testing
- Use the browser (or tools like Vue DevTools) to interact with the running Vue.js app.
- Ensure API calls are properly routed to the backend.
